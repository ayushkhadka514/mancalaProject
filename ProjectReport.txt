Our code correctly has implemented the Mancala game and the random move vs random move game simulator works correctly and we are able to simulate n many games. For the results, we used n=100 games.
RESULTS:
When using two random players, the first move advantage is around 58% according to our simulations. That is, the player that moves first wins the game around 58% of the time (although, this does vary depending on seed).
The amount of games won was 56 for player 1, and 40 for player 2, while 4 ended in a tie. 
The average amount of turns taken by player 1 was 20.31, and the average amount of turns taken by player 2 was 19.79.

Moving forward we will need to implement AI using minimax and alpha-beta pruning and hopefully the average number of moves decreases and we make a more optimal computer.
